## üéì MIT Emerging Talents Program

This project is part of the **MIT Emerging Talents Program** developed by **Group 13: Data Mavericks**. The program focuses on applying advanced data science techniques to solve real-world problems in emerging markets, with emphasis on cryptocurrency adoption patterns during economic crises.

## üéØ Project Overview

This research project analyzes how cryptocurrency P2P trading patterns correlate with economic and political crises in emerging markets using professional visualization and statistical analysis. The system successfully collects, processes, and visualizes crisis correlation data across 6 target countries.

## üìä Current Capabilities & Results

### ‚úÖ Complete Data Collection Infrastructure

- **513 P2P advertisements** collected from Binance across crisis countries
- **10+ years of cryptocurrency price history** (Bitcoin: 3,968 days, 2014-2025)
- **Real-time exchange rates** and premium calculations
- **9 documented crisis events** with precise correlation timelines

### ‚úÖ Professional Visualization System

- **4 comprehensive plot types** with publication-quality output (300 DPI)
- **Executive dashboard** with automated insights generation
- **Crisis correlation analysis** with historical volatility mapping
- **Market structure visualization** showing buy/sell pressure patterns

### ‚úÖ Crisis Evidence Collected

- **Sudan (SD)**: 107 ads - 96% sell pressure (+547.6% premium) - Active crisis
- **Venezuela (VE)**: 200 ads - Balanced market - Mature crypto adoption
- **Argentina (AR)**: 200 ads - Normal premiums - Stable conditions
- **Afghanistan (AF)**: 6 ads - Isolated market - Post-crisis impact

## üöÄ DEMO: How to Run the Complete Analysis

### Step 1: Setup Environment

```bash
# Clone and navigate
git clone <repository>

## üìà Key Research Findings

### Primary Research Question

*How do P2P cryptocurrency premiums correlate with economic crisis events?*

**Evidence**: Sudan shows 547.6% premium with 96% sell pressure during active political crisis, while Argentina shows normal 2-5% premiums during stable periods.

### Market Pattern Discovery

- **Crisis Countries**: Heavy sell pressure (>90% sell ads)
- **Stable Countries**: Balanced markets (40-60% buy/sell ratio)
- **Premium Correlation**: >100% premium indicates active crisis impact

### Historical Correlation Analysis

- Bitcoin volatility spikes correlate with major crisis events
- Afghanistan Taliban takeover: 15% volatility spike
- Sudan military coup: Sustained premium elevation
- Venezuela crisis: Gradual adoption pattern shift

## üìä Visual Analysis Results - Professional Visualizations

### 1. Premium Analysis Visualization

- **Bottom Left**: Premium vs Market Size correlation - Larger markets tend to have more stable premiums
- **Bottom Right**: Crisis severity assessment - Clear classification of High Crisis (Sudan, Afghanistan) vs Stable markets

**Key Insights:**

- Sudan's 547.6% premium is a clear crisis indicator showing people paying massive premiums to exit local currency
- Afghanistan shows negative premium (-12.2%) indicating market isolation post-Taliban takeover
- Venezuela's balanced premium (~10%) with high volume shows mature cryptocurrency adoption
- Argentina's normal premiums (2-5%) confirm stable economic conditions
