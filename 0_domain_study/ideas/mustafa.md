## Project Idea 1: Personal Spending Habits & Budget Analysis

**Author:** Mustafa Mangal
**Date:** 2025-06-12

### Problem Statement: Spending Habits & Budgeting

How do personal spending patterns vary across different categories
over time? What insights can be derived to optimize budgeting
for individuals?

### Potential Dataset: Personal Budget Transactions

**Kaggle: "Personal Budget Transactions Dataset"** offers records
including categories, dates, and amounts spent. This dataset is ideal
for financial analysis and budgeting insights.

### Expected Value: Actionable Budget Optimization

This project will provide **actionable insights** into how spending
habits evolve. It'll help individuals identify areas for potential
savings, optimize their budgets, and achieve financial goals. By
focusing on specific trends, this project can offer unique, tailored
advice beyond generic budgeting tips.

### Proposed Approach: Analyzing Spending Data

**Step 1: Data Collection & Understanding.** Download the dataset.
Familiarize yourselves with columns like `DateTime`, `Category`,
and `Amount` to understand transaction types.
**Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing.** Handle missing values and
inconsistencies. Ensure `DateTime` is in a usable format for
time-series analysis and `Amount` is numeric.
**Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).** Calculate monthly
income/expenses, identify frequent expense categories, and determine
average spending per category.
**Step 4: Data Visualization.** Create visuals: bar charts for
spending by category, line graphs for monthly expenditure trends,
and pie charts for expense distribution.
**Step 5: Insight Generation & Recommendations.** Analyze seasonal
spending, discretionary vs. essential spending ratios, or the impact
of hypothetical events. Formulate actionable recommendations for
budget optimization.

## Project Idea 2: Understanding Financial Literacy Across Demographics

**Author:** Mustafa Mangal
**Date:** 2025-06-12

### Problem Statement: Financial Literacy Disparities

How does financial literacy, measured by key indicators, vary across
U.S. demographic groups (age, education, income)? What are the
implications for targeted financial education initiatives?

### Potential Dataset: FINRA NFCS Data

**FINRA Foundation's National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) Data**
is a large-scale survey providing comprehensive data on U.S. adults'
financial capability, including financial knowledge and extensive
demographic information.

### Expected Value: Targeted Financial Education

This project will highlight **specific financial literacy gaps**
within different population segments. This provides valuable insights
for designing more effective and **targeted financial education
programs**. It can inform policymakers and educators on where
resources are most needed to improve overall financial well-being.

### Proposed Approach: Analyzing Financial Literacy

**Step 1: Data Collection & Understanding.** Download the latest
FINRA NFCS data. Review the codebook and questionnaire to understand
survey questions and demographic variables.
**Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preparation.** Clean survey data, handling
missing values and ensuring demographic and financial literacy
variables are correctly formatted for analysis.
**Step 3: Descriptive Statistics & Comparative Analysis.** Calculate
financial literacy scores (e.g., based on "Big Three" questions) for
different demographic groups (age, gender, education, income). Compare
these scores to identify disparities.
**Step 4: Data Visualization.** Create visuals like bar charts,
histograms, or heatmaps to clearly illustrate financial literacy
levels and gaps across various demographic segments.
**Step 5: Identify Key Gaps & Propose Interventions.** Based on the
analysis, identify significant financial literacy gaps. Propose
specific, tailored financial education initiatives or communication
strategies for identified underserved demographic groups.
