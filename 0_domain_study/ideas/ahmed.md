## Idea 1: Blockchain Adoption for Financial Inclusion in Developing Countries

### Problem statement  

Can cryptocurrency and blockchain systems improve financial inclusion in  
developing countries facing banking restrictions?

### Potential dataset(s)  

- [World Bank Global Findex Database](https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/) –  financial access indicators  
- [Chainalysis Crypto Adoption Index](https://www.chainalysis.com/) –  country-level blockchain usage  
- [IMF Financial Access Survey](https://data.imf.org/?sk=E5DCAB7E-A5CA-4892-A6EA-598B5463A34C) – access to financial services globally

### Expected value / insight  

Millions in developing regions are unbanked due to limited infrastructure,  
government restrictions, or inflationary pressure. Blockchain may offer  
low-barrier, trustless alternatives for basic financial services. This project  
aims to explore whether there is a measurable impact or correlation between  
crypto adoption and improved access to digital finance.

### Proposed approach  

- Step 1: Compare unbanked population percentages to regional crypto  
  adoption scores  
- Step 2: Identify case studies (e.g., Nigeria, Venezuela) where crypto use  
  increased due to banking restrictions  
- Step 3: Analyze if crypto usage correlates with improvements in remittance  
  inflows, savings activity, or inflation hedging  
- Step 4: Explore challenges and limitations of crypto-based inclusion and  
  summarize policy-level implications

## Idea 2: Can Financial Collapse Predict the Onset of War?

### Problem statement 2  

Can financial instability — such as inflation, economic collapse, or supply  
shocks — serve as an early warning indicator for future wars or crises?

### Potential dataset(s) 2  

- [UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset](https://www.prio.org/Data/Armed-Conflict/UCDP-PRIO/) – conflict data with regional timelines  
- [World Bank Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators) – inflation, GDP, unemployment
- [FAO Food Price Index](https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/) – global and regional food price trends
- [ACLED](https://acleddata.com/) – real-time political violence and protest data

### Expected value / insight 2  

Most people assume wars create economic collapse. But often, the reverse is  
true. This project flips that narrative: are financial warning signs — like  
inflation spikes, food insecurity, or falling GDP — reliable indicators of  
future conflict? If strong signals exist, they could inform crisis prevention  
strategies in fragile regions.

### Proposed approach 2

- Step 1: Select conflict-affected regions and collect financial data from  
  1–3 years before the conflict  
- Step 2: Track economic patterns (e.g., inflation, food prices, unemployment)  
  leading to conflict onset  
- Step 3: Use statistical methods to identify thresholds that often precede  
  conflict (e.g., inflation > 50%, food index spikes)  
- Step 4: Build a visualization tool or early-warning framework to flag  
  potential hotspots based on financial data
