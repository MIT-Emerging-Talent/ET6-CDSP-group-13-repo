## Idea 1: Blockchain Adoption for Financial Inclusion in Developing Countries

### Problem statement

Can cryptocurrency and blockchain systems improve financial inclusion in
developing countries facing banking restrictions?

### Potential dataset(s)

- [World Bank Global Findex Database](https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/)
- [Chainalysis Crypto Adoption Index](https://www.chainalysis.com/)
- [IMF Financial Access Survey](https://data.imf.org/?sk=E5DCAB7E-A5CA-4892-A6EA-598B5463A34C)

### Expected value / insight

Millions in developing regions are unbanked due to limited infrastructure,
government restrictions, or inflation. Blockchain may offer low-barrier,
trustless access to basic financial services. This project explores whether
crypto adoption correlates with improved access to digital finance.

### Proposed approach

- Step 1: Compare unbanked population data with crypto adoption scores.
- Step 2: Identify case studies (e.g., SUDAN, Venezuela) with increased crypto
  use during banking restrictions.
- Step 3: Analyze if crypto usage aligns with improved remittances or savings
  behavior.
- Step 4: Summarize infrastructure challenges and policy insights.

## Idea 2: Can Financial Collapse Predict the Onset of War?

### Problem statement 2

Can financial instability — such as inflation, economic collapse, or supply
shocks — serve as an early warning indicator for future wars or crises?

### Potential dataset(s)2

- [UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset](https://www.prio.org/Data/Armed-Conflict/UCDP-PRIO/)
- [World Bank Development Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)
- [FAO Food Price Index](https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/)
- [ACLED](https://acleddata.com/)

### Expected value / insight 2

Many believe war causes economic crises. But in fragile states, economic
breakdowns often come first. This project aims to test whether financial
collapse—especially inflation, food price spikes, or falling GDP—can act as
an early warning system for conflict.

### Proposed approach 2

- Step 1: Select regions with recent conflicts and collect financial indicators
  from 1–3 years prior.
- Step 2: Track trends like inflation, food insecurity, and unemployment
  before conflict.
- Step 3: Identify thresholds (e.g., food index spike or >50% inflation) that
  precede conflict.
- Step 4: Build a simple model or visualization tool to flag potential crisis
  zones based on financial stress.
