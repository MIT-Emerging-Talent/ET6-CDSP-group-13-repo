## Problem Statement

How can machine learning and real-time spending data be leveraged to provide
 personalized, proactive financial management tools that improve
  literacy and reduce financial stress among university students?

---

## Potential Dataset(s)

- Real-time student transaction data from mobile banking and payment apps
- Student Financial Wellness Survey (SFWS) data on financial behaviors and attitudes
- Public economic and spending benchmarks
 (e.g., U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data)

---

## Expected Value / Insight

- Equip students with actionable, personalized budgeting advice based on their
 own spending habits
- Enable early detection and intervention for students at risk of financial
 distress, preventing debt accumulation
- Improve studentsâ€™ financial literacy, savings behavior, and overall financial
 well-being, thereby reducing stress and promoting academic success

## Proposed Approach

**Step 1**: Collect and preprocess real-time spending data combined with survey
 data to build a comprehensive financial profile for students  
**Step 2**: Develop and train machine learning models (e.g., linear regression,
 random forest, gradient boosting) to predict financial outcomes and identify
  risk factors  
**Step 3**: Create a user-friendly mobile application with AI-powered budgeting
 and predictive alerts, providing personalized recommendations and real-time
  feedback  
**Step 4**: Implement behavioral nudges and interventions to encourage
 responsible financial habits and assess their effectiveness  
**Step 5**: Evaluate model performance, user adoption, and overall impact on
 student financial wellness through quantitative metrics and feedback
