# Project Idea 1 – Lowering the Cost of Family Remittances with Bitcoin

**Author:** Sukhrob Muborakshoev  
**Date:** 2025‑06‑11  

## Problem statement

*Can the growing use of Bitcoin’s Lightning Network help families send money home at a lower cost?*

## Potential dataset(s)

- **World Bank Remittance Price Reports** – average fees for sending $200 along the busiest routes.  
- **Public Lightning Network statistics** – number of nodes, payment channels and total capacity.

## Expected value / insight

- Shows whether a new payment rail is already easing the burden on millions of migrant workers.  
- Helps charities, startups and policymakers decide where to focus efforts that make transfers cheaper.

## Proposed approach (high‑level)

1. Collect the two public datasets.  
2. Compare how Lightning activity and remittance fees change over time and across routes.  
3. Present clear, visual summaries and key takeaways in language all stakeholders can follow.

# Project Idea 2 – Bitcoin Adoption and Financial Inclusion

**Author:** Sukhrob Muborakshoev  
**Date:** 2025‑06‑11  

## Problem statement

*Are countries with rising Bitcoin use seeing fewer adults left without any bank or mobile‑money account?*

## Potential dataset(s)

- **Chainalysis Global Bitcoin Adoption Index** – yearly country scores.  
- **World Bank “Global Findex” survey** – share of adults who remain unbanked.  
- Basic country indicators (GDP per person, mobile‑phone access) for extra context.

## Expected value / insight

- Tests whether Bitcoin is starting to fill fundamental financial gaps.  
- Offers guidance to NGOs, wallet builders and regulators on where digital‑asset tools could matter most.

## Proposed approach (high‑level)

1. Combine the adoption scores, Findex survey and background indicators into a simple table.  
2. Look for broad patterns between Bitcoin uptake and the share of unbanked adults.  
3. Summarise findings in plain language, focusing on human impact rather than technical detail.
