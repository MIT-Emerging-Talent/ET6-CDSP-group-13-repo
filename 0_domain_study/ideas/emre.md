## Project Idea 1 – Customer Churn Prediction in Banking

### Problem Statement

What behavioral patterns indicate that a customer is likely to leave a bank,  
and how can we predict churn before it happens?

### Potential Dataset(s)

- [Bank Customer Churn Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/barelydedicated/bank-customer-churn-modeling)

### Expected Value / Insight

This project aims to identify early signals of customer churn,  
enabling banks to take proactive steps to retain customers.  
Understanding churn drivers can also help in designing  
better customer experience strategies.

### Proposed Approach

#### Step 1: Data Exploration & Understanding

- Explore customer features: tenure, credit score, balance, etc.  
- Identify feature distributions and correlations.

#### Step 2: Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.  
- Normalize data and deal with class imbalance (e.g., SMOTE).

#### Step 3: Model Training

- Apply classification models such as Logistic Regression,  
  Random Forest, or XGBoost.  
- Evaluate model performance using precision, recall,  
  F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

#### Step 4: Interpretation & Recommendations

- Use SHAP or feature importance to explain churn factors.  
- Recommend retention strategies for high-risk customer groups.

## Project Idea 2 – Personal Spending & Budget Optimization

### Problem Statement

How do individual spending habits change over time,  
and what actionable insights can be extracted to  
improve personal budgeting?

### Potential Dataset(s)

- [Personal Budget Transactions Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismetsemedov/personal-budget-transactions-dataset)

### Expected Value / Insight

This project provides meaningful insights into personal finance management  
by visualizing and analyzing spending behavior.  
It helps users make informed financial decisions and optimize their budget.

### Proposed Approach

#### Step 1: Data Collection & Understanding

- Explore dataset columns such as category, date, and transaction amount.

#### Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Convert date columns into time-series format.  
- Categorize and aggregate spending data by month and type.

#### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Identify top spending categories and monthly changes.  
- Compare discretionary vs. essential spending trends.

#### Step 4: Visualization

- Create pie charts, bar graphs, and time series plots  
  to show spending patterns.

#### Step 5: Recommendations

- Suggest cost-saving strategies, budgeting tips, and  
  realistic saving goals based on findings.
