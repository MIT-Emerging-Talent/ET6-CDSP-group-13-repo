# Domain Study – Cryptocurrency and Financial Inclusion

## Final Project Focus

### **The Role of Cryptocurrency in Fostering Financial Inclusion in Crisis-

Affected Countries**

This project explores how cryptocurrency—especially Bitcoin—is being used as
a financial tool in regions experiencing conflict, economic instability, or
banking collapse. We aim to analyze whether digital assets can serve as
inclusive financial infrastructure where traditional systems are inaccessible
or failing.

This idea emerged from both personal experience and domain research. Members
of our team, including Ahmed (from Sudan) and Mustafa (from Afghanistan),
have witnessed firsthand how crypto tools enabled financial participation
despite institutional breakdowns. This lived perspective inspired us to focus
on this domain and gave the topic meaningful personal relevance.

## How We Got Here: Narrowing Down the Ideas

We began with a broad brainstorming session across multiple perspectives.
These were the main three project themes we refined and evaluated:

### A. **Bitcoin Adoption & Financial Inclusion**

- **Ahmed’s Perspective**: Investigated whether blockchain systems can offer
  alternative access to financial services in countries with poor banking
  infrastructure or political conflict (e.g., Sudan, Venezuela).
- **Sukhrob’s Perspective**: Posed the question: *Are countries with rising
  Bitcoin adoption seeing fewer unbanked adults?*
- **Key Dataset Sources**:
  - Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index
  - World Bank Global Findex
  - IMF Financial Access Survey

### B. **Remittance Efficiency via Crypto Arbitrage**

- **Sukhrob’s Perspective**: Focused on Bitcoin Lightning Network to lower
  remittance costs for migrant families.
- **Clement’s Perspective**: Framed the idea as an ML-powered arbitrage
  optimizer across crypto and fiat corridors, aiming to reduce fees by 30–70%.
- **Key Dataset Sources**:
  - World Bank Remittance Price Reports
  - Binance/Coinbase/Wise APIs
  - IMF Exchange Rate Data

### C. **Personal Budgeting Insights**

- **Emre & Mustafa’s Perspective**: Looked at how individuals manage their
  spending and how machine learning can optimize budgets and deliver
  actionable advice.
- **Anass’ Contribution**: Focused on using real-time transaction data and ML
  to support university students in avoiding financial distress.
- **Key Dataset Sources**:
  - Kaggle Personal Budget Transactions Dataset
  - SFWS Survey data
  - Mobile banking data (hypothetical)

## Why We Chose Project A

We decided to pursue **"The Role of Cryptocurrency in Fostering Financial
Inclusion in Crisis-Affected Countries"** because:

- **Personal Connection**: Multiple team members have lived experience in
  crisis-affected regions where crypto filled a critical gap.
- **Global Relevance**: This issue affects millions worldwide and is evolving
  quickly.
- **Social Impact**: The research can inform NGOs, wallet developers, and
  policymakers about crypto’s real-world impact.
- **Feasible Scope**: Strong available datasets and case study opportunities
  allow us to ground the project in both data and storytelling.

## Resources and Tools We Will Use

- **LLMs & Research Assistants**: ChatGPT, Gemini for fast literature reviews,
  insight generation, and code prototyping.
- **Datasets**:

  - [Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index](https://www.chainalysis.com/)
  - [IMF Financial Access Survey](https://data.imf.org/)
- **Case Study Countries**: Sudan, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Nigeria
  (pending confirmation)
- **Analysis Tools**: Python (pandas, matplotlib), Jupyter Notebooks, data
  cleaning libraries

This folder will be regularly updated with domain notes, useful links,
summary PDFs, and insights from academic or news sources relevant to
financial inclusion and crypto adoption. The goal is to keep our
understanding focused, accessible, and aligned with our research question.
