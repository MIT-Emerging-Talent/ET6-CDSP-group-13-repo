## Presentation Script

This presentation, prepared by **Team Data Mavericks**, is titled:

### Introduction – The Reality We Face

"When banks collapse overnight, where do people turn for survival?"

- Financial systems in many crisis regions are failing.
- Millions lack basic financial services.
- People turn to alternatives such as **cryptocurrency** and **stablecoins**.

---

### Research Question

**Can cryptocurrency foster financial inclusion and economic resilience
in crisis-affected countries?**

---

### Data & Methodology

We analyzed several datasets and used cross-correlation methods:

- **Active Wallet Count** – adoption trends (2019–2024) in Lebanon,
  Sudan, Nigeria, and Afghanistan.
- **INFORM Crisis Severity Index** – humanitarian crisis tracking.
- **Global Findex (World Bank)** – 1,200+ inclusion indicators.
- **USDT Trading Volume** – stablecoin demand via Python APIs.
- **Crypto Access Barriers** – exchange access via web scraping.

**Approach:** correlate crisis severity, crypto adoption, and inclusion metrics.

---

### Data Limitations & Challenges

- Proxy measures: active wallets rely on search interest.
- Temporal gaps: crisis data is annual; intra-year shifts are missed.
- Geographic limits: some countries and exchanges are excluded.
- Access issues: some sources are restricted or paid.

---

### Key Findings

- **Stablecoin usage rises in crises.**
  - 2021: pandemic → flight to digital safe havens.
  - 2024: tensions and bank stress → remittances via crypto.
- **USDT spikes correlate with:**
  - global uncertainty, bank stress, and cross-border payment needs.
- **Country notes:**
  - **Sudan:** USD scarcity → 50–200% BTC premiums.
  - **Afghanistan:** post-sanctions isolation → crypto transfers.
  - **Nigeria:** strong adoption despite restrictions → P2P hub.
  - **Venezuela:** hyperinflation → daily use of crypto.
  - **Lebanon:** banking crisis since 2019 → digital asset flight.

**Bottom line:** crypto adoption accelerates when banks fail.

---

### Target Audience

1. **Policymakers and regulators** – central banks and agencies.
2. **International organizations** – World Bank, IMF, UN, NGOs.
3. **Financial institutions** – banks and fintechs for the underbanked.

---

### Why This Matters

- Guides design of **resilient financial infrastructure** in crises.
- Validates stablecoins as **crisis-resistant alternatives**.
- Supports policies that expand **financial inclusion**.

---

### Closing

Crypto is not only speculative. It can be a **financial lifeline**.

Our findings suggest:

- High premiums → capital controls or system failure.
- Large volumes → weak institutional banking.
- Volatility spikes → political and economic shocks.

**Together, we can make finance more inclusive and resilient.**
