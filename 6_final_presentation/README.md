## Presentation Script

This presentation, prepared by **Team Data Mavericks**, is titled:  
**“The Role of Cryptocurrency in Fostering Financial Inclusion in Crisis”**.  

It explores how systemic financial collapse impacts vulnerable populations and
whether cryptocurrency can serve as a catalyst for **financial inclusion and
economic resilience**.

### Introduction – The Reality We Face

“When banks collapse overnight, where do people turn for financial survival?”  

- Financial systems in crisis-affected countries are failing.  
- Millions are excluded from basic financial services.  
- Populations turn to alternatives such as **cryptocurrency and stablecoins**.  

---

### Research Question

**Can cryptocurrency act as a catalyst for financial inclusion and economic
resilience in crisis-affected countries?**

---

### Data & Methodology

We analyzed multiple datasets and applied cross-correlation techniques:

- **Active Wallet Count** – Adoption trends (2019–2024) in Lebanon, Sudan,
  Nigeria, Afghanistan.  
- **INFORM Crisis Severity Index** – Humanitarian crisis tracking.  
- **Global Findex (World Bank)** – 1,200+ indicators of financial inclusion.  
- **USDT Trading Volume** – Stablecoin demand analysis via Python API.  
- **Crypto Access Barriers** – Exchange accessibility mapping with scraping.  

**Analytical approach:**  
Cross-correlation between crisis severity, crypto adoption, and
financial inclusion metrics.

---

### Data Limitations & Challenges

- Proxy measures: Active wallet counts rely on search interest.  
- Temporal granularity: Crisis data is yearly, missing intra-year changes.  
- Geographic scope: Some exchanges/countries excluded.  
- Data availability: Limited access due to restrictions or paid APIs.  

---

### Key Findings

- **Stablecoin surge during crises**  
  - 2021: COVID-19 pandemic → flight to digital safe havens.  
  - 2024: Geopolitical tensions & banking instability → remittances via crypto.  

- **USDT spikes correlate with**:  
  - Global financial uncertainty  
  - Banking system stress  
  - Increased cross-border payment needs  

- **Country-specific insights**:  
  - **Sudan**: USD scarcity → 50–200% BTC premiums.  
  - **Afghanistan**: Post-sanctions isolation → crypto as transfer method.  
  - **Nigeria**: Adoption despite restrictions → P2P hub.  
  - **Venezuela**: Hyperinflation → crypto mass adoption for daily use.  
  - **Lebanon**: Banking crisis since 2019 → flight to digital assets.  

**Bottom line:** Crypto adoption accelerates when traditional financial
infrastructure fails.

---

### Target Audience

1. **Policy Makers & Regulators** – Central banks, government agencies.  
2. **International Organizations** – World Bank, IMF, UN, humanitarian NGOs.  
3. **Financial Institutions** – Banks and fintechs targeting underbanked.  

---

### Why This Matters

- Provides insights for **designing financial infrastructure** in crisis
  economies.  
- Validates crypto and stablecoins as **crisis-resistant alternatives**.  
- Supports policies that expand **financial inclusion** in fragile contexts.  

---

### Closing

Crypto is not merely speculative—it is a **financial lifeline** in times of
systemic collapse.  

Our findings confirm:  

- High premiums = capital controls or systemic failures.  
- Large trading volumes = institutional banking failure.  
- Volatility spikes = political and economic events.  

**Together, we can make financial systems more inclusive and resilient.**
