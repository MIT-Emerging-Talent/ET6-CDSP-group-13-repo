# Communication Strategy

## 1. Target Audience

The project is primarily intended for:

- **NGOs and policymakers** – to understand financial resilience and inclusion during crises.  
- **Financial institutions and regulators** – banks, exchanges, and supervisory bodies analyzing crisis-period financial flows.  
- **Academics and researchers** – studying the role of stablecoins, macroeconomic shocks, and crisis-driven financial behaviors.  
- **General public** – individuals interested in crisis impacts, stablecoin use, and financial awareness.

## 2. Capabilities and Constraints

### Capabilities

- Data-driven analysis combining cryptocurrency market data, macroeconomic indicators, and crisis timelines.  
- Advanced visualization using Python libraries.  
- Integration of heterogeneous data sources (APIs, CSV, manual datasets).  
- Identification of patterns in USDT volumes and crisis events to measure financial inclusion.  

### Constraints

- Limited availability and granularity of crisis-specific financial data.  
- API restrictions and potential gaps in historical records.  
- Legal and regulatory heterogeneity across countries.  
- Dependence on secondary sources for some socio-economic indicators.

## 3. How We Intend to Reach Them

### Primary Channel: Open-Source Visualizations & Reports

- GitHub repository containing datasets, analysis scripts, and plots.  
- Transparent and reproducible results for stakeholders.  

### Supporting Channels

- Medium/blog articles to communicate findings in a narrative-driven, accessible way.  
- Academic paper draft with detailed methodology and technical depth.  
- Conference/workshop presentations focused on crisis resilience and financial inclusion.

## 4. What We Want Them to Learn

- Stablecoin usage (USDT) increases during crises as a form of financial safety.  
- USDT volume spikes can serve as an indicator of financial vulnerability.  
- Alternative financial tools are crucial for financial inclusion in crisis zones.  
- Traditional finance and crypto markets may form a complementary relationship during shocks.
