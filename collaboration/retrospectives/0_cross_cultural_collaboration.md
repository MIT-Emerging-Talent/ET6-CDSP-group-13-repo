# Retrospective: Cross-Cultural Collaboration Week  

*MIT Emerging Talents Program – Collaborative Data Science Project*  
*Week 1*

---

## 🌟 Overview  

This first week marked the beginning of our Collaborative Data Science Project
journey. It was an exciting time for the team as we got to know one another and
started laying the foundation for our collaboration.

---

## 🤝 Team Dynamics and Collaboration  

Although some team members were initially not fully up to speed, we gradually
came together and are now functioning effectively as a cohesive unit. We
successfully filled in parts of the documentation in our project repository and
began mentally preparing for the journey ahead.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced  

- **Time Zone Differences:** Being spread across different time zones made
scheduling meetings and synchronous collaboration difficult.  
- **Busy Schedules:** Everyone has day-to-day responsibilities and commitments,
which initially made it hard to coordinate our efforts.  
- **The "New Adventure" Effect:** At the start, there was some uncertainty about
roles, leadership, and next steps. We didn’t always know who to ask or what to
do next, which slowed initial momentum.

## 🌱 Progress and Growth  

Despite these challenges, the team chemistry has started to build strongly. We
have moved past the initial uncertainties and are now working proactively and
collaboratively. Everyone is engaged and contributing, which bodes well for the
success of our project.

---

## 🔮 Next Steps  

- Continue strengthening communication channels to better manage time zone
  differences.  
- Clarify roles and responsibilities to maintain momentum.  
- Keep building on the documentation and project implementation.  
- Foster ongoing team engagement and support.

week. The progress we’ve made together is encouraging and sets a positive tone
for the weeks to come.
