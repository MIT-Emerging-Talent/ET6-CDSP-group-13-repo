# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

* Relying too much on real-time meetings for discussion and brainstorming.
Scheduling across time zones and balancing full-time commitments made this
approach inefficient at times.
* Leaving idea convergence open-ended for too long. Earlier checkpoints for
decision-making would improve flow.

## Continue Doing

* Encouraging input from all team members. Everyone brought valuable ideas and
perspectives that enriched our brainstorming phase.
* Anchoring the project in personal experience and regional insight.
These perspectives brought relevance and human depth to the topic.
* Keeping clear documentation of our thought process and decision trail.

## Start Doing

* Utilize asynchronous communication tools more proactively (e.g. Slack, GitHub,
Issues, shared documents).
This will help us collaborate more efficiently across time zones.
* Begin early search and curation of datasets related to our selected research topic.
* Define testable sub-questions or hypotheses as we gather data to guide our
analysis scope.

## Lessons Learned

* Strong collaboration and open idea sharing helped us arrive at a research
question with personal, regional, and global relevance.
* Domain exploration benefits from both technical feasibility and grounded storytelling.
* Effective team coordination requires adjusting for time constraints and
leveraging async tools for progress.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

* We explored multiple angles within the broader theme of financial inclusion
and refined a strong, relevant research question.
* Every team member participated actively, contributing ideas that helped shape
our final direction.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

* Scheduling synchronous meetings was challenging due to time zone and
availability conflicts.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

* We naturally integrated geopolitical context and lived experiences into our
brainstorming, which deepened the project focus.

### Or remove extra steps?

* No major steps were removed; rather, we prioritized and organized our ideas
to converge on the most impactful direction.

## Next Steps

* Begin data gathering for the selected topic: "The Role of Cryptocurrency in
Fostering Financial Inclusion in Crisis-Affected Countries."
* Refine or adjust the research question as needed, depending on dataset
availability and initial exploration.
* Continue to use collaborative tools to track progress and contributions.
