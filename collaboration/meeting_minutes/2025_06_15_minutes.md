### The Role of Cryptocurrency in Fostering Financial Inclusion  

in Crisis-Affected Countries

---

## 🔹 Discussion Summary

- The team agreed to move forward with the crypto and  
  financial inclusion topic, especially focusing on  
  crisis-affected or underbanked regions.

- It was suggested to combine datasets from multiple sources, such as:
  - Cryptocurrency adoption trends
  - Crisis impact data (e.g., from the UN or World Bank)

- The project will follow a **correlational approach**:  
  Rather than proving direct causality, the team aims to identify patterns  
  and time-based relationships between variables.

## 🔹 Action Items & Responsibilities

- Meeting minutes will be documented regularly.
- The team agreed to rotate responsibility for writing the minutes.
- A follow-up meeting is scheduled for **Tuesday, 2025-06-17**,  
  after Evan’s workshop to discuss dataset findings.

## 🔹 Additional Notes

- Meeting minutes should remain concise and use the existing template.
- Notes should be posted on Slack and committed to the GitHub repository.
