## 4. Shortlisting Process

The team narrowed down to **three high-potential ideas**, each of which was
suggested by multiple members:

### A. Bitcoin Adoption & Financial Inclusion

* **Ahmed's perspective:** Study Bitcoin adoption in third-world countries as a
tool for inclusion—allowing participation in the global financial system
regardless of context (e.g., conflict or instability).
* **Sukhrob's perspective:** *"Bitcoin Adoption and Financial Inclusion: Are
countries with rising Bitcoin use seeing fewer adults left without any bank or
mobile-money account?"*

### B. Remittances Efficiency via Crypto Arbitrage

* **Sukhrob's perspective:** *"Can the growing use of Bitcoin’s Lightning
Network help families send money home at a lower cost?"*
* **Clement's perspective:** *"Can we identify inefficiencies in the \$685 B
remittance market using real-time crypto arbitrage and ML to slash transfer
costs by 30–70%?"*

### C. Personal Budgeting Insights

* **Emre's perspective:** *"How do individual spending habits change over time,
and what actionable insights can be extracted to improve personal budgeting?"*
* **Mustafa's perspective:** *"How do personal spending patterns vary across
different categories over time? What insights can be derived to optimize
budgeting for individuals?"*

## 5. Decisions

* The three ideas above were shortlisted for further consideration.

## 6. Next Steps

* Each member should **further reflect on the shortlisted ideas** and **assess
which one we can fully commit to as a group**.
* Members who feel that these options don’t fully align with their vision are
encouraged to bring **one well-supported alternative idea** to the next meeting
for final review.
