# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

This document will be updated as the project evolves. Each team member is
welcome to contribute by adding any constraints they encounter or agree on
during the work.

## External

Constraints coming from outside the team that we have no control over:

- Time zone and scheduling differences: Our team is distributed across
  different time zones, and most members are either full-time students or
  working full-time. This makes real-time collaboration and scheduling
  meetings challenging.

- MIT Emerging Talent deadlines: Since this project is part of the MIT
  Emerging Talent Program, we must adhere to the academic deadlines and
  deliverables provided.

- Tool limitations for meetings: We rely on free versions of Zoom and Google
  Meet, which limit meetings to 30 minutes. As a result, we often need to
  create new links to continue the conversation when the time runs out.

## Internal: Involuntary

Constraints from within the team that we canâ€™t change:

- Tight personal schedules: All team members are juggling either full-time
  jobs, full-time academic commitments, or both. This limits daily working
  hours and availability.

- Skill diversity and specialization: While the team has strong overall
  capability, certain specialized technical areas may not be fully covered
  due to differing backgrounds.

## Internal: Voluntary

Constraints we decide on as a team to guide our work and scope:

- Code review policy: Each merge request must be assigned to two reviewers
  before it is approved and merged into the main branch.

- Process agreement: We agreed to use GitHub for version control, and all
  progress and documentation should be reflected in pull requests and issues.

- Collaborative editing: Each member is encouraged to contribute to key
  documents like this one, with GitHub history used to track all updates.
